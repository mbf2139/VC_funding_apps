## Usage

1. To run the program navigate to the repo and run the ***GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb*** file

2. In the ***Resources*** folder you will find the data used for this analysis

3. The program will then encode the categorical data for analysis 

4. The data will then be scaled and the model compiled 

5. Finally the model will be optimized for testing 

6. The final sections of the repo contain alternative models
